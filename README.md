🎣 Fish Counting and Length Estimation System

Stereo Vision-Based Automated Fish Monitoring
This project implements a computer vision system for detecting, tracking, counting, and measuring fish using stereo camera data. The system combines YOLO11-based object detection, ByteTrack multi-object tracking, and depth-based length estimation in a unified pipeline. Additionally, a Flask-based web interface provides a user-friendly environment for video processing.
📋 Features

🎯 Fish Detection: High-accuracy fish and container box detection using YOLO11
🐟 Tracking & Counting: Identity-preserving counting logic with ByteTrack and ROI crossing
📏 Length Estimation: Real-world length estimation using stereo disparity maps (two alternative methods)
🌐 Web Interface: Video upload and result visualization via Flask
⚡ Real-Time Processing: Optimized pipeline for fast inference
